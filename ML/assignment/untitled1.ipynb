    "When creating custom exceptions in a programming language like Python, it is recommended to derive your custom exception class from the built-in Exception class. The Exception class serves as the base class for all exceptions in Python, forming the hierarchy for handling errors and exceptional situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why using the Exception class is beneficial when creating custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency with the Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from Exception, your custom exception becomes part of the existing exception hierarchy. This hierarchy allows for a consistent and organized approach to handling different types of exceptions.\n",
    "The hierarchy includes various specialized exception classes (e.g., ValueError, TypeError, FileNotFoundError) that can be used for specific error scenarios. By using Exception as the base, your custom exception fits into this structure.\n",
    "Interoperability with Exception Handling Mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling mechanisms in programming languages often rely on the exception hierarchy to catch and handle specific types of exceptions. If your custom exception is derived from Exception, it can be caught along with other exceptions using a common except block.\n",
    "Clarity and Readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deriving from Exception makes the purpose of your custom exception clear. It signals to other developers that your class represents an exceptional condition and is intended to be used in exception-handling scenarios.\n",
    "Avoiding Ambiguity:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you create a custom exception without inheriting from Exception, it might be unclear to other developers and tools whether your class is intended for use in exception handling. Inheriting from Exception removes any ambiguity and aligns your custom exception with established conventions."
